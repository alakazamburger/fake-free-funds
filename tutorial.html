        <h1>The Basics</h1>

        <p>Hi, welcome back.</p>

        <p>There are a few things you should know about this website.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>"Fake Free Funds"?</h3>
        <p>Ignore the unnecessarily alliterative name for now. Fake Free Funds, or FFF, is the <b>main currency</b> used on the website.<br>
            Every hour you're allowed to press the "Mine" button, and after an hour you will have earned 1 FFF.<br>
            You must manually come back to collect your FFF, and to restart the timer.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Automation Limit (AL)</h3>
        <p>Once you've earned enough FFF, you can spend it on increasing your <b>automation limit</b>.<br>
            This limit increases how much FFF is automatically mined, but 
            <span style="color:rgb(255, 169, 169)">you must watch a 30-second advert to start the automation.</span>
        </p>
        <p>For example, when you first start, your AL is 1. This means <b>every hour you have to check back</b> on the website to claim your FFF.<br>
            But once you spend 10 FFF on upgrading your AL, you only have to check back <b>once every 2 hours</b>.<br>
            You can still check back at any amount of hours you wish, but to restart the automation you will have to watch another advert.<br>
            <span style="color:rgb(152, 228, 137)">The amount of automated collections will be visible in the top left (eventually).</span>
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>AL Pricing Formula</h3>
        <p>The price of your next AL is as follows (where n is your current AL):<br>
            <b><i>cost of next upgrade = floor(10(n^1.1))</i></b><br>
            For example, if n = 3:<br>
            <i>cost of next upgrade = floor(10(n^1.1)) = floor(10(<b>3</b>^1.1)) = floor(10(<b>3.3484</b>)) = floor(<b>33.484</b>) = 33</i><br>
            Therefore the cost of the next upgrade is 33.
